        <h1>Hello, I'm Vaishnavi Tandel</h1>
        <p class="animated-text"></p>
        <p>
            I am a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development. I enjoy 
            exploring modern web technologies and frameworks, and I regularly build small projects to 
            strengthen my practical skills and deepen my understanding of both front-end and back-end development. 
            Through hands-on experimentation and continuous learning, I aim to improve my problem-solving abilities
            and prepare myself for a career in software development.

            <h3>PetSpeak</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on analyzing pet emotions through audio recordings by leveraging 
                techniques from signal processing and machine learning. The system captures sounds 
                made by pets such as barking, meowing, or whining—and extracts meaningful audio features 
                like pitch, frequency, intensity, and spectral patterns. These features are then 
                processed using classification models to identify emotional states such as happiness, 
                stress, aggression, or discomfort.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Virtual HR</h3>
            <p>The system can evaluate candidates using structured questionnaires, coding tests, 
                or recorded video/audio interviews, analyzing responses based on predefined criteria 
                such as technical skills, communication ability, problem-solving approach, and overall 
                suitability for the role. Using scoring algorithms or machine learning models, it generates 
                objective evaluations and shortlists candidates, reducing human bias and saving recruiters 
                significant time.</p>
